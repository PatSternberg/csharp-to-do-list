# What does this application do?

When the application starts, it should print:

> Hello!
> What do you want to do?
> [S]ee all TODOs
> [A]dd a TODO
> [R]emove a TODO
> [E]xit

The user must select one of the given S, A, R, E options. The selected option can be both uppercase or lowercase, so it doesn’t matter if the user types “S” or “s” - both should go to the “see all todos” case. The user can keep selecting different options until the option “[E]xit” is selected, which will close the application.
